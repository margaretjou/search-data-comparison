## About

This project examines how the 2019 Hong Kong protests are described on YouTube by analyzing the description text on videos returned when using the search term “hong kong protests 2019.” Data was collected using this same search term across three different locations: Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Taipei. For each location, the YouTube videos returned by the search were scraped, and the top 100 most frequently occurring words from the video description boxes were visualized using wordclouds. These 3 word clouds are used to compare how the same political event is discussed in different geographic contexts.

## Location Comparison
This comparison was conducted to explore whether geographic location influences how the Hong Kong protests are framed and described on YouTube. The three selected locations represent different distinct political and cultural perspectives: Shanghai, a major city within mainland China; Hong Kong, the site of the protests themselves; and Taipei, a city with a complex political relationship with China. By comparing the word usage in Youtube descriptions across these locations, this project aims to identify differences in emphasis and narrative regarding the protests that may reflect each location’s political environments or public opinion.
